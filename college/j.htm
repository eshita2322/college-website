    <b>Jhulta Minar, Ahmedabad </b>
    <br><br>
Located in Ahmedabad, Jhuta Minar is one of the most intriguing architectural wonders that the world has ever seen. They are still an unsolvable mystery. What makes the minarets unique is if one of the minarets is shaken then the other minaret shakes within a few seconds, while the connecting passage doesn't transmit any movements or vibrations. Many architects and historians have tried to understand the physics and logic behind the unrelated movements of the minarets. It is these movements that have led to its name, Jhulta Minar which translates to swinging minaret.

The 500-year-old structure is located in the Sakar Bazar of Ahmedabad. It was initially a part of the Sidi Bashir Mosque which was later torn down during a Gujrat Sultanate war. The minarets were to be the entrance of the mosque. The minarets have a striking architecture that makes them stand out and leave the visitors in awe. The curiosity behind the movement of these minarets is not new, many British men during the Raj have tried to understand the reason for their movement. One Englishman almost had the minarets taken down to understand why they tend to move the way they do.
<b>History:</b>
The history behind the construction of the minarets is conflicting between two stories. The first one states that Sultan Ahmed Shah had the mosque constructed by one of his slaves, Sidi Bashir, and that is where the name of the mosque originated. The construction of this mosque is believed to have completed by 1452 only to be later destroyed in 1753 during a war between Marathas and Khans of the Gujrat Sultanate.

The second story states that the minarets were built as a part of a mosque built by Malik Sarang, a noble in the court of Muhammed Begada who was anther Sultan of Gujrat. The style and material used to construct the minarets are close to that of Muhammed Bagada's reign thereby placing its construction sometime in 1511 or later. Unfortunately, during the demolishing of the mosque's main body all traces of its name and date have disappeared which makes it very difficult to trace the history of the minarets.
