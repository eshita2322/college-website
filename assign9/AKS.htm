   <b>History of Akshardham Temple, Ahmedabad</b><br>
The term Akshardham means the divine abode of God and as the name specifies, Akshardham temple of Gandhinagar was built in honour of Swaminarayan by BAPS Swaminaryan Sanstha. Inspired by the fourth successor of Swaminarayan, Yogiji Maharaj and created by Pramukh Swami, the temple was built in honour of Swaminarayan.

Yogiji Maharaj along with Pramukh Swamiji Maharaj had been the backbone in the progress of BAPS. The classical piece of architecture dating back to the fifteenth century also houses the idol of revered Gunatitanand Swami and Gopalanand Swami.

Gunatitanand Swami was a great sage who had been more popular as Akshar Brahm. Legends state that he had divine vision or Divya Drishti through which he had seen Swaminarayan in his childhood.

An influential speaker, Gunatitanand served as a Mahant or the head of the Swaminarayan temple in Junagadh for forty years. He played a crucial role in spreading Swaminarayanâ€™s teachings to the common man and was referred to as the first spiritual successor of Swaminarayan.

Gopalanand Swami was a paramhansa of Swaminarayan Sampraday who had spent most of his time in Vadodara spreading the teachings of Swaminarayan. He was known for his excellence in all the eight stages of Yoga.
