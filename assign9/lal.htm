<b>History of Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum</B><br>
A renowned industrialist Shri Kasturbhai Lalbhai along with the famous monk and scholar Jain Acharya Muni Puniyavijayiji set up the Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Institute of Indology. Muni Puniyavijayiji gave all his valuable collection of manuscripts, bronze and cloth paintings to the institute. A thought of establishing a museum emerged as the collection grew in numbers and a need to safeguard it was realised.

Next to the L.D. Institute of Indology, a building built by prominent architect Shri Balkrishna Doshi was chosen to host the rich collection of the artefacts. In 1985 the then Governor of Gujarat, Shri Brajkumar Nehru inaugurated the Museum.

This impressive museum was designed with two galleries named Muni Puniyavijayji Gallery and Smt. Madhuri Desai Gallery. Later in 2004 an additional gallery called the Priyakant Munshaw Gallery was set up.

Museum has its own conservatory laboratory which has the facility of cleaning, repairing and restoring the artefacts to preserve them for a longer period. The Art Reference Library and Conservation Laboratory were developed with the assistance of the Ministry of Culture, New Delhi 2012-2013.
