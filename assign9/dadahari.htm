    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Dada Hari ni Vav</h1>
    Gujarat is one of the most vibrant and colorful states of India and all its cities represent the culture and heritage of the state elaborately. Ahmedabad is one such city which is a true reflection of Gujarati culture. Right from authentic Gujarati cuisine to the sightseeing places, everything draws tourists to this place from all over the world in large numbers. The city is dotted with malls and shopping complexes but there is another part of the city that is dotted with architectural delights and places that must be on your visit list if you happen to be in Ahmedabad.

Some wonders of the world do not make it to the top seven but they are nonetheless worth a visit at least once in your lifetime. They could have a rich history attached to them, could be architectural wonders or could be both and Dada Hari ni Vav in Ahmedabad is one such place. In the quiet neighborhood of Asarwa village, this stepwell is like a hidden gem of the city.

Vav means a step well and Gujarat is known for its iconic stepwells, right from the ones in Baroda to those in Patan. There are almost 120 stepwells in the state. These stepwells were used to store water with the steps around it to make it easily accessible. The reason behind building these stepwells was the climate of Gujarat. The climate here has always been semi-arid and the unpredictable and sometimes scanty rainfall.

Long before modern means of storing water were developed, these stepwells were the most efficient way of storing water for the people of the city. They were also used as resting places by travelers who used to take a break from their journey at these stepwells. It was here that they refilled their supply of water and rested on the steps.

These stepwells were not just a tank with steps and filled with water. They are, in fact, a work of art, showcasing excellent craftsmanship and depicting the heritage of the city. They are truly symbolic of the culture prevalent in the city when they were built.

All these stepwells are dried up now, with modern means of storing water in use but they are now historical sites. They are visited by people interested in history, archaeology or those simply interested in admiring architectural beauty. There has been evidence of these vavs having existed even in the Indus Valley civilization. So they have essentially been a part of Indian history for a long time.

<B>History of Dada Hari ni Vav</B><BR>
Ahmedabad has two such vav and one of them is the Dada Hari ni Vav. It is a five-hundred-year-old vav, built during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Begada. There is a slight confusion as to the exact year of construction of this vav. A Persian inscription on the wall of this stepwell states that it was built in the year 1485 while a Sanskrit inscription on another wall states the year of its construction as 1499 A.D.

This vav was built by Bai Harir Sultani, who was the superintendent of the Royal Harem and the household lady of Mahmud Begada. Her tomb in the Sultani Mosque is right behind Dada Hari ni Vav. At that time, the cost of construction of this vav had come out to be almost 3,29,000 Mahmudis (money used during those days). This amount is more than one lakh rupees in today’s times.

<B>Architecture of Dada Hari ni Vav</B><BR>
Dada Hari ni Vav has seven storeys, each one equally resplendent in its beauty. Marked by intricately carved walls, columns, and pillars, the stepwell looks magnificent during the daytime when you can see the work. The architectural style of this vav is a mélange of both Muslim and Hindu styles. You will also find Arabic and Sanskrit scriptures on the walls along with floral motifs and traditional carvings.

Most people get their pictures clicked while standing on the railing overlooking the vav below. The stepwell is octagonal and it is an amazing sight to look down from the top storey of the stairwell. Equally thrilling is going down all the steps and looking up, while the sunlight filters in from the center of the vav. Below the railing of each floor, at the portion jutting out, there is a design that looks like a toran or hanging of stone.

What adds to the old world charm of this stepwell is the cloud of bats who decide to make their grand entrance from the nooks behind the walls and pillars. The spiral staircase and the landing area at each level are big enough to accommodate a good number of people.

There are air and light vents in the roofs at all the floors and also at the landing level. Because of these openings at various places you do not feel claustrophobic at all at any point. From the first story level, three staircases lead to the lowest level of the stepwell and this is a fascinating feature of this stepwell.
